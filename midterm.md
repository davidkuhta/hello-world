## Important Terms

A relation schema can be thought of as the basic information describing
a table or relation. This includes a set of column names, the data types associated
with each column, and the name associated with the entire table. For example, a
relation schema for the relation called Students could be expressed using the following
representation:
Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string,
age: integer, gpa: real)
