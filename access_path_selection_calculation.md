###Access Path Selection Calculation

####Given the following query (select a>10 from relation ***R***):

Ïƒ<sub>a>10 - R

|R| = 10,000 (the size of the relation in pages)  
Each Page Contains 100 bytes  
Tuples/page = 10  
Number of Directory Entries (DE)/page = 100  
The domain of **a** is an integer type with the **min** = 0 and the **max**=100  


Assume we have the following indexes:  

B+ Tree(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Index&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hash(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+ Tree(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Index  

(**Q1**) Assume you want to do a file scan - how much does the file scan access path cost?  In other words, how many pages, worth of units, does it take, to execute this using a file scan?  
(**A1**) 10,000 pages because we have to read every page of **R** and since we are doing pipeline execution, the cost is the size of **R**.  
  
(**Q2**) Now assume we are considering the hash index **Hash(a)** - how much does it cost for a hash index?  
(**A2**) 10,000 beause a hash index is only good for equalities so we have to scan anyway.  

(**Q3**) For the B+ Tree Primary Index -
